## About Me

I am an aspiring Front End Developer. Looking for a job/internship, preferably in React. Currently I have no commercial experience. 🚀

I have been studying IT for 3 semesters at AGH. I chose Software Development path. I started seriously programming in June of 2022. In addition to studying for classes in my free time I self-study in Front End development. 🎓

I am an extroverted 20 yo Male. 😊

You can see more repos on my [profile](https://github.com/karmatys8?tab=repositories). 👈

#### Note

Although I used to do way more commits, most of them were singular file updates. Right now every commit is a new feature/bug fix etc. In fact I use Git and GitHub way more than before.
