# Hi there! 👋

## 😎 About Me

I am an aspiring Front End Developer. Looking for a job/internship, preferably in React. Currently I have no commercial experience. 🚀

Currently studying at AGH. I am on my 3rd semester of IT on the Software Development path. I started seriously programming in June of 2022. In addition to studying for classes in my free time I self-study. 🎓

I am an extroverted 20 yo Male. If you have any questions feel free to ask and I may be able to help you. 😊

### ✨ Hobbys

💪 Bodybuilding.

🍜 Watching anime.

🐲 Playing board games.

## 💾 Projects

I am currently working on [stock-market-dashboard](https://github.com/karmatys8/stock-market-dashboard). 📈

My last project is [RECOMmusicENDATIONS](https://github.com/karmatys8/RECOMmusicENDATIONS). ⌛

#### 📄 Note

Although I used to do way more commits, most of them were singular file updates. Right now every commit is a new feature/bug fix etc. In fact I use Git and GitHub way more than before.
