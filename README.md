## About Me

I am an aspiring Front End developer. Looking for a job/internship, preferably in React. At the moment I have no commercial experience. 🚀

I have been studying IT for 3 semesters at AGH, following the Software Development path. I started seriously programming in June of 2022.
In addition to studying for classes in my free time I self-study in Front End development. 🎓

I am an extroverted 20 yo male. 😊

As I am bilingual and so is this GitHub profile, some repositories are only available in one language. Translating all of them would take me too much time. 😕

### Hobbys

💪 Bodybuilding.

🍜 Watching anime and reading manga.

🐲 Playing board games.

## Projects

I'm currently immersed in my studies, requiring several projects. The most intriguing ones are creating a database and developing an online shops website. Unfortunately, to prevent plagiarism, they're set as private until the semester ends. 👨‍🎓

My most recent project is [Recruitment task for BIT WEB](https://github.com/karmatys8/BIT_WEB_recruitment_task). ⌛

You can see more repos on my [profile](https://github.com/karmatys8?tab=repositories). 👈

Project [stock market dashboard](https://github.com/karmatys8/stock-market-dashboard) is currently postponed due to the heavy studies workload. 📆

#### Note

Although I used to commit way more, most of them were singular file updates. Currently every commit is a new feature, bug fix etc.
In fact I am using Git and GitHub significantly more often than before.
