# Hi there! üëã

[Polska wersja](translations/README_pl.md)

## About Me

I am an aspiring Front End developer. Looking for a job/internship, preferably in React. At the moment I have no commercial experience. üöÄ

I have been studying IT for 4 semesters at AGH, following the Software Development path. I started seriously programming in June of 2022.
In addition to studying for classes in my free time I self-study in Front End development. üéì

I am an extroverted 20 yo male. üòä

As I am bilingual and so is this GitHub profile, some repositories are only available in one language. Translating all of them would take me too much time. üòï

### Hobbys

üí™ Bodybuilding.

üçú Watching anime and reading manga.

üê≤ Playing board games.

## Projects

Currently working on [Shopping website](https://github.com/karmatys8/WDAI-Projekt). üõí

My most recent project is [Recruitment task for BIT WEB](https://github.com/karmatys8/BIT_WEB_recruitment_task). ‚åõ

You can see more repos on my [profile](https://github.com/karmatys8?tab=repositories). üëà

#### Note

Although I used to commit way more, most of them were singular file updates. Currently every commit is a new feature, bug fix etc.
In fact I am using Git and GitHub significantly more often than before.
